New York: Then and NowMy proposal for a class publication is to have the theme comparing New York City in the present to various times in the past. For example, if someone is interested in architecture they could compare Times Square in the 1920’s to what it’s like now. This is a theme that is highly adaptable to people’s interests i.e. homeless policy, ethnic communities, demographics and most importantly: imagery. The strength of the website will depend greatly on its ability to visually engaging for the viewer while also being informative.There is a book called New York Then and Now: http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Then-Now-City/dp/0486233618
